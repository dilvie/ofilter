# Deprecated - use [MOUT](http://moutjs.com/)

I built this, planning to recreate the whole suite of Array extras and Underscore functional iterators for objects, sets, and maps, and then somebody pointed out that the bulk of this work has already been done. It's called MOUT, and it is completely modular. You can require the whole library, or only the function you need. Even better, the modularity works with AMD, Node, or Browserify, so you can use it just about everywhere you need it. This is where it's at, guys. Time to break our Underscore addiction.


## ofilter

Similar to `Array.prototype.filter`, except that it works on objects, and returns an object.

## Usage

```
ofilter(object, callback[, thisObject])
```

## Parameters

`object` is the object you want to filter.

`callback` is a function that will be called for each key in `object`.

`thisObject` is an optional object to use for `this` inside `callback`.


```
var o = {
  a: {prop: 1},
  b: {prop: 'b'},
  c: {prop: 1}
},

filtered = ofilter(o, function (item) {
  return item.prop === 1;
});

ok(filtered.a && filtered.c,
  'should contain positive matches.'); // Pass

ok(!filtered.b,
  'should not contain negative matches.'); // Pass
```


## Crazy talk

This (along with several other common functional iterators) really needs to be part of the JavaScript specification. I can't recommend actually extending the `Object` prototype, but if you use `ofilter()` enough, maybe eventually, if we all believe hard enough, it will magically appear in a future version of the ECMAScript specification.


```
if (!Object.prototype.filter) {
  Object.prototype.filter = function (callback, thisObject) {
    return ofilter(this, callback, thisObject);
  }
}

var obj = {a: 'a', b: 'b'};

var a = obj.filter(function (item) {
  return item === 'a';
});

t.same(a, {a: 'a'},
  'should work like Array.prototype.filter(). Come on, TC39!');
```
